      <h2 class="section__title">Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We take your privacy very seriously. We will only use the personal information which we collect about you if you have opted into this. We will ensure that all such information is processed fairly and lawfully, in accordance with current legislation. The following statement sets out our policy regarding the personal information which we collect through the brother-ism.com website (the "Website"). Please also see our Website Terms and Conditions.</p>
      <h4>customers and business partners</h4>
      <p><a href="#">Information on the collection of personal data in accordance with Articles 13, 14 and 21 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for our customers and business partners</a></p>
      <h4>1. Information we collect</h4>
      <div class="privacy__list">
        <p>The website of the Brother collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.</p>
        <p>When using these general data and information, the Brother does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the Brother analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>2. Use of cookies</h4>
      <div class="privacy__list">
        <p>1. A cookie is a text file that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. Cookies only record those areas of a website that have been visited by your computer and for how long.</p>
        <p>2. This Website uses the following two types of cookies:</p>
        <p>3. Session Cookies - these are temporary cookies which remain on your computer until you leave the Website and allow you to carry information across pages of the Website without having to re-enter information.</p>
        <p>4. Persistent Cookies - these remain on your computer after you leave the Website.</p>
        <p>5. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the setting in your browser. If you would like to do this, please see the help menu of your browser. However, you may not be able to use all the interactive features of our Website if cookies are disabled.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>3. Information we use</h4>
      <div class="privacy__list">
        <p>1. We use the information collected to provide and personalise our services both on-line and off-line. This may include using your information for the purposes of administering product warranty services. It may also include dealing with your enquiries, conducting quality assurance and/or training our staff.</p>
        <p>2. In particular, our Persistent Cookies help us to recognise you when you return to the Website and allow us to tailor content or advertisements to match your preferred interests or to avoid showing you the same adverts repeatedly. We may use third parties to assist in this monitoring and analysis.</p>
        <p>3. Where you have opted-in, we may use the information for marketing and promotional purposes. For example, this may include providing you with promotional offers and/or information about products and services. At the time that we collect your personal information, we will usually provide you with a specific opportunity to indicate whether you want to receive marketing/promotional offers. If, at any time, you would like to opt-out of receiving future marketing and promotional material from us, you can simply complete and submit this form.</p>

We cannot identify you personally this way.</p>
        <p>5. The Brother Group operates on a world-wide basis and it may therefore be necessary in relation to each of the various purposes outlined above for us to pass your information to other members of the Brother Group or to other third parties who provide assistance in the provision of our services to you.

      <h4>Newsletter</h4>
      <p>The newsletter of the Brother contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, the Brother may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data subjects. We are using Newsletter2Go. See additional below.</p>
      <h4>Conversion Tracking</h4>
      <p>This page uses the online-advertising program "Google AdWords" and Conversion-Tracking in the framework of Google AdWords. The cookie for conversion-tracking is set if a user clicks on an ad activated by Google. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer system. These cookies become invalid after 30 days and do not identify you personally. If the user visits certain pages on this website and the cookie is not yet expired, we and Google can recognize that the user has clicked on the ad an was redirected to this page.</p>
      <p>Every Google AdWords-customer receives a different cookie. Cookies cannot be traced across the websites of other AdWords-customers. The information gathered with the help of Conversion-Cookies only serves to generate conversion statistics for AdWords-customers who have decided to use Conversion-Tracking. The customers learn the total number of users who have clicked on their ads and who have been re-directed to a site equipped with a Conversion-Tracking-Tag. They do not however get any information that could be used to identify users personally. If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can refuse this use, by easily deactivating the Cookie for Google Conversion-Tracking using your Internet-Browser under your user settings. Then you will not be included in the Conversion-Tracking statistics.</p>
